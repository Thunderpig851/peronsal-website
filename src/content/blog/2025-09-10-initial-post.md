# Hello, Iâ€™m Cameron Estep ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the internet! Iâ€™m a software engineer who loves exploring new technologies, solving tricky problems, and sharing what I learn along the way. This site is my space to document projects, write about experiments, and reflect on my journey as both a developer and a learner. Not to mention it was a pretty good way to get acquainted with Svelte.

### What youâ€™ll find here
- **Projects**: deep dives into what Iâ€™m building, including successes, challenges, and lessons learned.  
- **Reflections**: thoughts on my growth as an engineer, teamwork, and how technical communication shapes good software.  
- **Resume**: My personal resume available for print or download.

### Why this blog?
Iâ€™ve always believed that writing things down makes you a better thinker. By publishing openly, I hope to not only clarify my own understanding but also contribute something useful to other developers, students, or anyone curious about this craft.

### A little about me
- Based in **Boone, NC**.  
- Currently focusing on full-stack development, with strong interests in data privacy, software security, and thoughtful design.  
- Outside of coding, youâ€™ll usually find me hiking with the dogs, reading, or playing Magic: the Gathering.
