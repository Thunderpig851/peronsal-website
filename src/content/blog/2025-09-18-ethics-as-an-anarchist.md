# Thinking About Ethics: My Anarchist Perspective

When we talked about ethics in class, most people quickly latched onto *utilitarianism* as their preferred framework. The idea that we should simply do “the greatest good for the greatest number” has a clear, mathematical appeal. But I couldn’t help noticing that these claims never got tested. Nobody actually pressed deeper into what it means to weigh lives, experiences, or happiness on some universal scale. It’s easy to say you’re a utilitarian—it’s much harder to prove it in practice.

Personally, I don’t identify with utilitarianism. My own beliefs align more closely with **anarchism** and, within philosophy, something closer to **social contract theory**. At first glance, those might seem contradictory: anarchists are skeptical of authority, while social contract theory is often used to justify the existence of states and laws. But for me, the “contract” isn’t about obeying governments—it’s about recognizing the *mutual agreements and responsibilities* that people freely make with each other. If there’s any grounding for ethics, it’s found in the relationships we negotiate, not rules handed down from above.

## Ethics without rulers
As an anarchist, I reject divine command theory outright. The idea that morality comes from a god feels outdated and unconvincing. Morality, for me, is a living practice built in community, not decreed from an external authority. In that sense, anarchism pairs well with a contract-based ethic: we continually renegotiate what it means to live together well, without coercion and without pretending there’s one single formula for “the good.”

## Why utilitarianism feels shallow
This is why I found the classroom embrace of utilitarianism so uncritical. Utilitarianism looks tidy on paper, but real life doesn’t break down into units of pleasure and pain that we can stack up neatly. If anything, it risks justifying harmful systems if those in power can argue that the harm is outweighed by some greater good. For me, that’s not good enough. Ethics can’t just be a numbers game—it has to be about consent, autonomy, and mutual respect.

## Where I stand
So here’s where I land:  
- **Ethics is negotiated, not imposed.** We create moral obligations by choosing how we live together, not by appealing to gods or abstract utility.  
- **Anarchism shapes this view.** A world without rulers means people themselves decide, together, what fairness and care look like.  
- **Skepticism is necessary.** Easy claims to utilitarianism, or any single “universal” system, need to be challenged if they’re going to hold up.  

This isn’t a full ethical system—it’s a starting point. But for me, it’s a lot more honest than pretending we can calculate the good in advance.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. These ideas might not be neat or final, but they reflect where I am right now. And that’s the whole point of writing about ethics in the first place: to keep questioning, keep clarifying, and keep building something better together.
