            I’m a software engineer who loves turning tricky problems into simple, reliable systems. 
            When I’m not building fast APIs and clean UIs, I’m a husband and dog dad enjoying long hikes 
            and longer board-game nights. Here you'll find a collection of past and current projects, 
            reflections on my class work and life, as well as a full resume.
